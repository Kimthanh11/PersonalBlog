        <p>If you are looking for the perfect cream cheese pound cake recipe that turns out buttery, moist, and dense each and every time, add this year-round crowd-pleaser to your list! Using only 7 simple ingredients, this easy cream cheese pund cake will quickly become your favorite; serve plain with a sprinkle of powdered sugar or offer homemade whipped cream and berries, or a drizzle of salted caramel or fudge sauce.</p>

        <p>I consider a really good pound cake to be an essential for everyone’s recipe box or binder; if flavored the right way, it can stand on its own, but can also be dressed up with toppings or cut up to layer in a trifle. Whether you’re looking for a weeknight dessert or something everyone will love for a holiday or birthday party, this cream cheese pound cake will never let you down!</p>
        <p>It’s incredibly simple to make and while a standard pound cake does not contain cream cheese, it really adds such a tremendous amount of moisture, tenderness, and flavor, making it, in my opinion, the best ever. This is by far my absolute favorite pound cake recipe!</p>

        <h2  class="header">What exactly is a pound cake?</h2>
        <p>The first traces of pound cake recipes are in northern Europe in the 1700s and it has grown across the globe since. A cake that required equal parts of flour, butter, sugar, and eggs was easy to remember in a time where many could not read a traditional cookbook. It required nothing more than a spoon and some elbow grease in the kitchen. Hundreds of years later, nearly every region is making its own version of this moist, dense cake.</p>
        <p>In some French-speaking countries, rum is added as a Christmas Eve tradition. In both Mexico and Germany, dried fruit and liquor are added. I have some other variation ideas below, and they’re all phenomenal! Cream cheese pound cake is an American twist on the classic, and it is downright delicious.</p>
        <p>Many modern recipes, including this one, adjust the original one pound-only proportions to accommodate some other ingredients (like cream cheese!).</p>

        <p>Storage: The cake can be kept, wrapped tightly with plastic wrap or in an airtight container, at room temperature for up to 4 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>
        <p>Freezing Instructions: Wrap the cake tightly in two layers of plastic wrap, then a layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight, then bring to room temperature before slicing and serving.</p>
